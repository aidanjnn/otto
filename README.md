# OTTO 🎤

> Voice-first situational awareness agent for engineering teams

Otto is not a chatbot or dashboard. It's your senior engineer teammate who already read all the PRs, Slack threads, and emails—and gives you the 60-second version out loud.

## Features

- **Voice-first interface** powered by LiveKit
- **7 integrations**: GitHub, Slack, Teams, Notion, Gmail, Calendar, Linear
- **Smart briefings**: "What do I need to care about today?"
- **Natural follow-ups**: "Tell me more about Aidan's branch"
